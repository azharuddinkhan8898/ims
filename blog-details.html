                As a veterinarian, I’ve found that pet owners take seriously the
                responsibility of ensuring their dogs live healthy, happy lives.
                They worry about making sure their dog gets enough exercise,
                receives regular wellness checks and receives balanced nutrition
                that gives them energy to run and play.
              </p>
              <p>
                What some people don’t realize is that owning and caring a dog
                can improve the owner’s health as well. Spending quality time
                with your dog and providing them with quality nutrition is good
                for the dog and can help ease stress and anxiety levels for you.
                Studies have shown that owning a pet can decrease blood
                pressure, cholesterol levels and triglyceride levels<sup
                  ><a href="#interlink-1">1</a></sup
                >
                — which is great news for your heart health.
              </p>
              <p>
                In short, when your dog is getting the best care, proper
                exercise, nutrition and love, they can enjoy a long and healthy
                life. And that can ultimately make you healthier, too!
              </p>
              <p class="green-color bold-text">
                So what does that mean when it comes to feeding your dog?
              </p>
              <p>
                Many owners see their dog as part of the family, and that
                sometimes means they will feed their dog like they feed
                themselves. For example, some people may choose low-carb or
                gluten-free diets for themselves and do the same for their pets.
                However, while this instinct comes from a place of love, many
                owners don’t realize that their dog’s dietary needs differ from
                their own.
              </p>
              <p>
                Take grains for example. As a veterinarian, it’s important for
                me to note that grains are good for your dog. Yes, you read that
                right — they’re good!
              </p>
              <p>
                A very small percentage of dogs may have a food sensitivity that
                requires a special grain-free diet or a dog food without a
                certain protein. However, this is not necessary for the vast
                majority of dogs. Most dogs benefit from a complete, balanced
                diet with healthy grains, high-quality proteins and essential
                vitamins and minerals.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here’s why: Grains are a good source of carbohydrates that
                provide healthy energy. Some grains, like rice and wheat,
                provide “quick” energy, while other grains, like barley and
                sorghum, take longer to convert to energy. A combination of
                these different grains can offer a time-released energy source
                that helps dogs sustain energy. The whole grains in IAMS dog
                food are a beneficial mix, as they supply steady energy.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to the grains you’ll find in IAMS food, you’ll also
                find high-quality proteins, like chicken and lamb, as well as
                essential nutrients needed to help support heart health.
                Together, this combination will give your dog a steady source of
                energy to be active on walks, runs, hikes or play sessions
                around the house.
              </p>
              <p>
                For your dog to be healthy and happy, be sure you feed them a
                well-balanced diet and allow them enough exercise time. In
                return, you’ll get unconditional love, plenty of sweet doggy
                snuggles and maybe even more exercise — just a few of the ways
                you and your dog are joined at the heart.
